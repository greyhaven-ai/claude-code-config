SKILL DOCUMENTATION COVERAGE ANALYSIS - COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Skills Analyzed: 42 skills across 12 plugins

Documentation Status:
  - Comprehensive (5-6 items):  0 skills (  0%)
  - Adequate (3-4 items):       34 skills ( 81%)
  - Minimal (1-2 items):        5 skills ( 12%)
  - Missing all docs (0 items): 3 skills (  7%)

Overall Finding: 81% of skills have adequate documentation, but there's room
for significant improvement. No skills achieve comprehensive coverage across
all 6 documentation types.


DOCUMENTATION TYPE COVERAGE
================================================================================

File-Based Documentation:
  EXAMPLES.md    5/42  ( 11.9%) - SEVERELY UNDERUTILIZED
  REFERENCE.md   5/42  ( 11.9%) - SEVERELY UNDERUTILIZED

Directory-Based Documentation:
  examples/      32/42 ( 76.2%) - WELL ADOPTED
  reference/     30/42 ( 71.4%) - WELL ADOPTED
  templates/     30/42 ( 71.4%) - WELL ADOPTED
  checklists/    25/42 ( 59.5%) - MODERATELY ADOPTED

KEY INSIGHT: The codebase has overwhelmingly adopted a DIRECTORY-BASED
approach over FILE-BASED markdown files. Only 12% of skills have EXAMPLES.md
or REFERENCE.md, while 71-76% have the corresponding directories.


DOMINANT PATTERN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: Directory-Based Documentation (34 skills / 81%)
→ PRIMARY STANDARD IN USE

Structure:
  - examples/      (practical examples and use cases)
  - reference/     (conceptual reference material)
  - templates/     (boilerplate code/config files)
  - checklists/    (actionable checklists)

Examples:
  - agent-orchestration / context-management
  - core / documentation-alignment
  - core / project-scaffolding
  - developer-experience / api-design-standards
  - incident-response / smart-debugging

Advantages:
  ✓ Scalable for complex documentation
  ✓ Separates conceptual from practical content
  ✓ Easy to navigate with INDEX.md files
  ✓ Supports code examples and templates directly


PATTERN 2: File-Based Documentation (1 skill / 2%)
→ OUTLIER (Should be migrated)

Structure:
  - EXAMPLES.md
  - REFERENCE.md

Example:
  - browser-automation / browser-automation

Disadvantages:
  ✗ Limited for code examples
  ✗ Can become unwieldy
  ✗ Inconsistent with 81% of skills


PATTERN 3: Mixed Approach (4 skills / 10%)
→ TRANSITIONAL (Should be standardized)

Structure:
  - EXAMPLES.md + examples/
  - REFERENCE.md + reference/
  - templates/
  - checklists/

Examples:
  - core / code-style
  - core / testing-strategy
  - developer-experience / code-style
  - testing / testing-strategy

Note: These represent "best of both worlds" but add documentation overhead.


PATTERN 4: No Documentation (3 skills / 7%)
→ CRITICAL GAPS

Skills Needing Immediate Documentation:
  1. developer-experience / ontological-documentation
     Current: SKILL.md + non-standard directories (references/, assets/, scripts/)
     Gaps: No checklists, inconsistent naming
     
  2. security / security-practices
     Current: SKILL.md only (essentially empty)
     Gaps: All documentation missing
     
  3. testing / memory-profiling
     Current: SKILL.md only (essentially empty)
     Gaps: All documentation missing


NAMING INCONSISTENCIES DETECTED
================================================================================

Issue 1: "references/" vs "reference/"
  Location: developer-experience / ontological-documentation
  Current:  references/ (with 's')
  Standard: reference/ (singular, used by 30 other skills)
  Action:   Rename to match standard

Issue 2: Non-Standard Directory Names
  Location: developer-experience / ontological-documentation
  Found:    assets/, scripts/, references/
  Standard: examples/, reference/, templates/, checklists/
  Impact:   Creates 3 directory naming variations vs established pattern

Issue 3: Scripts Directories
  Location: Found in 4 skills
    - core / testing-strategy
    - deployment / deployment-cloudflare
    - developer-experience / ontological-documentation
    - testing / testing-strategy
  Status:   Not part of standard documentation structure
  Action:   Consider if scripts/ is needed or move to templates/

STANDARDIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION 1: Adopt Directory-Based Standard
Priority: CRITICAL (81% already do this)

Standard Structure for All Skills:
  skill-name/
  ├── SKILL.md                 (already exists in all)
  ├── EXAMPLES.md              (optional - for quick ref, reference examples/ dir)
  ├── REFERENCE.md             (optional - for quick ref, reference reference/ dir)
  ├── examples/
  │   ├── INDEX.md             (NEW: required if examples exist)
  │   └── *.md, *.py, *.ts    (practical examples)
  ├── reference/
  │   ├── INDEX.md             (NEW: required if reference exists)
  │   └── *.md                (conceptual reference)
  ├── templates/               (NEW: required for all)
  │   ├── INDEX.md
  │   └── *.md, config files
  └── checklists/              (NEW: required for all)
      ├── INDEX.md
      └── *.md                (actionable checklists)

Action Items:
  → Add INDEX.md to all directories for navigation
  → Make checklists/ and templates/ mandatory
  → Create 2-3 checklists per skill (completion, review, troubleshooting)
  → Create 1-2 templates per skill where applicable

Estimated Effort: 20-30 hours to bring all skills to 5/6 coverage


RECOMMENDATION 2: Fix Naming Inconsistencies
Priority: HIGH

Actions:
  1. Rename developer-experience/ontological-documentation/references/ → reference/
  2. Consolidate scripts/ usage:
     → Move scripts to templates/ with documentation
     → OR create a standard for when scripts/ is acceptable
  3. Rename assets/ to examples/ (if image/visual examples)
     → OR create guidance for when assets/ is acceptable
  
Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours


RECOMMENDATION 3: Complete Critical Documentation Gaps
Priority: CRITICAL

Skills requiring immediate attention:
  1. security/security-practices - BUILD FROM SCRATCH
     → Create examples/, reference/, templates/, checklists/
     → Add EXAMPLES.md and REFERENCE.md
  
  2. testing/memory-profiling - BUILD FROM SCRATCH
     → Create examples/, reference/, templates/, checklists/
     → Add EXAMPLES.md and REFERENCE.md
  
  3. developer-experience/ontological-documentation - REORGANIZE
     → Rename references/ to reference/
     → Consolidate scripts/ and assets/
     → Add missing checklists/

Estimated Effort: 8-12 hours


RECOMMENDATION 4: Create Documentation Templates
Priority: MEDIUM

Create in a central location (.claude/templates/ or similar):
  - SKILL.md template
  - EXAMPLES.md template
  - REFERENCE.md template
  - INDEX.md template (for directories)
  - Checklist template
  - Example template layout

These should be referenced in onboarding documentation.

Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours


RECOMMENDATION 5: Create Documentation Standards Guide
Priority: MEDIUM

Create a new document: grey-haven-plugins/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md

Should include:
  - Directory structure specification
  - File naming conventions
  - Required vs optional components
  - Examples from well-documented skills
  - Maintenance guidelines
  - Quality checklist

Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours
