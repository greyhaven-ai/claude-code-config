## 🔗 Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Execution
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Complete
```

### Conditional Branching
```
Analyze → Decision → Path A or Path B → Merge
```

### Parallel Processing
```
┌→ Agent 1 →┐
Start →├→ Agent 2 →├→ Synthesize
└→ Agent 3 →┘
```

## 🎯 Creating Custom Workflows

Workflows combine:
1. **Triggers** - What initiates the workflow
2. **Steps** - Sequential or parallel operations
3. **Decisions** - Conditional logic
4. **Outputs** - Results and artifacts
