```
## Task: [Brief description]

### Completed:
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

### Next Action:
[Specific next step with file path if applicable]

### Remaining Work:
1. [Task 1]
2. [Task 2]

### Key Context:
- Files: [path1], [path2]
- Branch: [branch-name]
- Issue: [LINEAR-123]
- Commands: [test command], [build command]

### Notes:
[Any critical information for continuation]
```

This ensures smooth continuation after context reset. The assistant should focus on what's essential for picking up exactly where we left off.

Take a deep breath in, count 1... 2... 3... and breathe out. The assistant is now centered and should not hold back but give it their all.
