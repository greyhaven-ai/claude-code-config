   - `name`, `version`, `description`
   - `author` (object format)
   - `license`, `category`, `keywords`
3. ✅ All command paths exist and are correctly declared
4. ✅ All source paths use correct `./` prefix
5. ✅ No unsupported schema fields (`categories`, `featured`)
6. ✅ Plugin structure follows Claude Code conventions

### Recent Fixes

**Commit 6fcf202**:
- Restructured 20 command files from flat structure to subdirectories

**Commit 88e0324**:
- Removed unsupported `categories` and `featured` fields

## Command Structure

All commands follow the subdirectory pattern required by Claude Code:

```
grey-haven-plugins/
└── grey-haven-core/
    └── commands/
        ├── tdd-implement/
        │   └── tdd-implement.md
        ├── code-review/
        │   └── code-review.md
        └── ...
```

Commands are explicitly declared in marketplace.json:
```json
{
  "name": "grey-haven-core",
  "commands": [
    "./commands/tdd-implement/",
    "./commands/code-review/",
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### For Fresh Installation

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub CDN to propagate changes
2. Open Claude Code
3. Remove existing marketplace (if any):
   ```
   /plugin marketplace remove grey-haven-plugins
   ```
4. Add marketplace:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add greyhaven-ai/claude-code-config
   ```
5. Verify all 13 plugins appear:
   ```
   /plugin
   ```
6. Install desired plugins:
   ```
   /plugin install grey-haven-core@grey-haven-plugins
   /plugin install grey-haven-skills@grey-haven-plugins
   ```

### Expected Result

All 13 plugins should appear in the marketplace browser with:
- Complete descriptions
- Correct categories
- All commands/skills/hooks discoverable

## Validation Tool

A Python validation script is available for future maintenance:

```bash
python3 validate_plugins.py
```

This script checks:
- All required metadata fields
- Author field format (object vs string)
- Category presence
- Resource counts (commands, skills, hooks)

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing Required:** Confirm all 13 plugins appear in Claude Code marketplace browser after installation
2. **Documentation:** If testing succeeds, create comprehensive INSTALLATION.md with:
   - GitHub marketplace installation
   - Local development setup
   - Troubleshooting guide
3. **Version Management:** Plan for plugin versioning strategy as features evolve

## Architecture Compliance

- Marketplace at repository root (`.claude-plugin/`)
