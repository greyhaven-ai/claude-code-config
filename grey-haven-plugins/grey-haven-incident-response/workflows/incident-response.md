# Incident Response Workflow - SRE Production Incident Management
Comprehensive incident response workflow implementing Google SRE best practices with multi-agent orchestration for rapid detection, mitigation, and learning.
## Overview
This workflow provides end-to-end incident management from detection through postmortem, orchestrating specialized agents for different phases of incident response. It follows the incident command system with clear roles, communication protocols, and continuous learning loops.
## Workflow Phases
### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (Minutes 0-5)
**Objective:** Quickly classify incident severity and assess customer impact.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Classify severity (SEV1/2/3/4)
 → Assess customer impact and affected services
 → Create incident ticket with initial details
2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="observability-engineer"
 → Check monitoring dashboards for anomalies
 → Correlate alerts across systems
 → Identify SLO violations and error budget impact
```
**Output:** Incident ticket, severity classification, initial impact assessment
**Decision Point:** If SEV1 (critical), immediately escalate to executives and proceed to Phase 2 with urgency.
---
### Phase 2: Incident Command & Communication (Minutes 5-10)
**Objective:** Establish incident command structure and begin stakeholder communication.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Assign incident commander role
 → Create war room (Slack channel, Zoom bridge)
 → Assign roles (technical lead, comms lead, scribe)
 → Post initial internal status update
2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Post external status page update
 → Notify customer support team
 → Brief executives if SEV1/SEV2
 → Set update frequency (SEV1: 15min, SEV2: 30min)
```
**Output:** War room created, roles assigned, initial communications sent
---
### Phase 3: Investigation & Root Cause Analysis (Minutes 10-30)
**Objective:** Identify root cause through systematic debugging and log analysis.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="devops-troubleshooter"
 → Analyze application and infrastructure logs
 → Check recent deployments for correlation
 → Identify error patterns and stack traces
2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="observability-engineer"
 → Query Prometheus metrics for anomalies
 → Analyze distributed traces in Jaeger
 → Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
3. Use Task tool with subagent_type="error-detective"
 → Search for similar past incidents
 → Correlate errors across microservices
 → Identify cascading failure patterns
4. Use Task tool with appropriate specialist (e.g., "backend-architect", "database-admin")
 → Deep dive into suspected root cause
 → Validate hypothesis with data
 → Recommend mitigation approach
```
**Output:** Root cause hypothesis, supporting evidence, mitigation options
**Decision Point:** If root cause unclear after 30 minutes, escalate to senior engineer and continue investigation in parallel with mitigation attempts.
---
### Phase 4: Mitigation & Resolution (Minutes 30-60)
**Objective:** Implement fix to restore service and verify customer impact resolved.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Evaluate mitigation options (rollback, scale, feature flag)
 → Make go/no-go decision on immediate fix
 → Coordinate deployment of mitigation
2. Use Task tool with domain specialist based on root cause:
 - "backend-architect" for application code issues
 - "database-admin" for database problems
 - "network-engineer" for network/connectivity issues
 - "security-analyzer" for security incidents
 → Implement mitigation (rollback, config change, hotfix)
 → Verify fix in staging if time permits
 → Deploy to production with monitoring
3. Use Task tool with subagent_type="observability-engineer"
 → Monitor metrics for recovery (error rate, latency)
 → Validate SLO metrics returning to normal
 → Check customer-facing indicators
```
**Output:** Mitigation deployed, service recovering, metrics improving
---
### Phase 5: Verification & Communication (Minutes 60-90)
**Objective:** Confirm full recovery and communicate resolution.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="observability-engineer"
 → Run smoke tests on critical paths
 → Verify all alerts have cleared
 → Confirm SLO metrics within target
 → Check error budget consumption
2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Post all-clear internal announcement
 → Update external status page (resolved)
 → Notify customer support of resolution
 → Brief executives on resolution and impact
 → Thank all responders publicly
```
**Output:** Service fully recovered, stakeholders informed, incident closed
---
### Phase 6: Postmortem & Learning (Within 48 Hours)
**Objective:** Conduct blameless postmortem and create action items to prevent recurrence.
**Agent Orchestration:**
```
1. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Schedule postmortem meeting within 48 hours
 → Assign facilitator (not incident commander)
 → Prepare timeline document from incident notes
 → Gather all logs, metrics, traces for analysis
2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Facilitate blameless postmortem discussion
 → Apply 5 Whys to identify root cause
 → Create fishbone diagram for contributing factors
 → Document learnings and systemic issues
3. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Create action items for prevention
 → Assign owners and due dates
 → Prioritize by impact and effort
 → Track in Jira/Linear
4. Use Task tool with relevant specialists for preventative measures:
 - "test-generator" → Create regression tests
 - "code-quality-analyzer" → Review code for similar patterns
 - "security-analyzer" → Audit for security implications
 - "observability-engineer" → Improve monitoring/alerting
5. Use Task tool with subagent_type="incident-responder"
 → Distribute postmortem report to organization
 → Update runbooks with new procedures
 → Share learnings in engineering all-hands
 → Archive incident for future reference
```
**Output:** Postmortem report, action items created, runbooks updated, team learning
