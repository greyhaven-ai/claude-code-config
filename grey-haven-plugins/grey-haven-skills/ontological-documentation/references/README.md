## Usage

These guides are designed to be used together:

1. Start with **ontology_patterns.md** to understand common patterns
2. Use **concept_extraction_guide.md** to extract concepts from your codebase
3. Apply **documentation_templates.md** to document your findings

## Integration with Main Skill

These references support the main [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) and are automatically available when the ontological documentation skill is activated.
