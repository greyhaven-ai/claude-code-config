# Buddy Checklist: [Your Name] → [New Hire Name]

**New Hire**: [Full Name]
**Role**: [Role Title]
**Start Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Your Role**: Buddy (Peer Support)

## Your Responsibilities

You're [New Hire]'s **buddy** for the next 12 weeks. Your job is to:
- Provide a safe space for "basic" questions
- Share tactical knowledge (where things are, how we work)
- Build social connection (be a friend at work)
- Model team culture (how we really work vs documentation)

**You're NOT**:

**Time Commitment**:
- Week 1: ~2 hours/day (pair programming, check-ins)
- Week 2-4: ~3 hours/week (check-ins, PR reviews)
- Week 5-8: ~1 hour/week (weekly check-ins)
- Week 9-12: ~30 min/week (casual check-ins)

## Red Flags to Escalate to Manager

**Immediately tell manager if you notice**:

### Technical Red Flags
- [ ] Not asking questions (sign of fear, not competence)
- [ ] Same mistakes repeatedly (not learning)
- [ ] Consistently missing deadlines
- [ ] Poor code quality not improving

### Behavioral Red Flags
- [ ] Isolated (not connecting with team)
- [ ] Defensive to feedback
- [ ] Negative attitude
- [ ] Not participating in team activities

### Communication Red Flags
- [ ] Not responding to messages
- [ ] Missing check-ins repeatedly
- [ ] Not sharing blockers

**How to Escalate**:
```
You [to Manager]:
"Hey, I wanted to flag something about [Name]'s onboarding.
[Specific observation]. I've tried [what you've done].
Wanted you to be aware."

Manager: "Thanks for the heads-up. I'll follow up."
```

**Remember**: You're support, not evaluation. Flagging concerns helps them succeed.

## Buddy Tips

### Do's ✅

- **Be proactive**: Don't wait for them to ask - offer help
- **Share context**: Explain the "why" behind decisions
- **Model learning**: "I don't know, let's find out together"
- **Celebrate wins**: First PR merged? Make a big deal!
- **Be patient**: Answer same question 3 times if needed
- **Be available**: Respond quickly (within 30 min during work hours)

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't evaluate**: You're support, not their manager
- **Don't rush**: Take time to explain fully
- **Don't assume**: They might not know Git basics - that's okay
- **Don't ghost**: If busy, say "I'm swamped, let me find someone else to help"
- **Don't just say LGTM**: Provide detailed PR feedback

---

## Self-Care for Buddies

**Buddying is work** - take care of yourself:

- [ ] **Block buddy time on calendar** (so meetings don't schedule over)
- [ ] **Set boundaries**: "I'm in a meeting now, can we chat at 2 PM?"
- [ ] **Ask for help**: "Manager, I'm swamped - can we reduce check-ins this week?"
- [ ] **Celebrate yourself**: You're investing in someone's career - that's meaningful!

**If it's too much**:
- Tell manager early (Week 2-3, not Week 10)
- "I underestimated time commitment - can we find additional support?"
- Better to speak up than burn out

---

## End of Buddying (Week 12)

### Reflection

- [ ] **What went well?**
  - [Write down your wins - you helped someone succeed!]

- [ ] **What was challenging?**
  - [Write down struggles for next time]

- [ ] **Would you buddy again?**
  - [ ] Yes, happy to!
  - [ ] Yes, but with adjustments: [what would you change?]
  - [ ] No, too much time commitment

- [ ] **Feedback for manager**
  - Share your reflection
  - Suggest improvements for next onboarding
  - Celebrate new hire's success!

### Final Message to New Hire

```
Hey [Name],

Our formal buddy relationship is ending (Week 12!), but I wanted to say:

You've come SO far since Day 1. Remember how nervous you were?
Look at you now - shipping features, reviewing PRs, fully part of the team.

I'm really proud of what you've accomplished. Keep up the great work!

We're colleagues now, not buddy/mentee, but I'm still here if you ever need anything.

Congrats on completing onboarding!

[Your Name]
```
