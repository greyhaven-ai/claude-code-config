## Abstract Writing

### The Four-Sentence Abstract

1. **Background**: One sentence on context
2. **Purpose**: One sentence on what you did
3. **Methods**: One sentence on how
4. **Findings**: One sentence on key results

### Example

```
Background: Machine learning models increasingly influence hiring
decisions, yet their fairness across demographic groups remains
understudied.

Purpose: This study evaluates bias in resume-screening algorithms
across gender and ethnicity.

Methods: We analyzed 50,000 resume evaluations from three commercial
screening tools using statistical parity and equalized odds metrics.

Findings: All three systems showed significant gender bias (p<0.01),
with female-associated names receiving 23% fewer callbacks despite
identical qualifications.
```

## Literature Review Patterns

### Chronological
Trace development of ideas over time.
```
Early research (1990s) focused on X...
Later studies (2000s) expanded to include Y...
Recent work (2020s) has challenged this by showing Z...
```

### Thematic
Organize by topic or concept.
```
Theme 1: Theoretical foundations
Theme 2: Methodological approaches
Theme 3: Practical applications
```

### Methodological
Group by research methods used.
```
Quantitative studies have found...
Qualitative research suggests...
Mixed-methods approaches reveal...
```

### Funnel
Move from broad context to specific gap.
```
Broad field overview →
Narrower subfield →
Specific topic →
Gap your research addresses
```

## Methodology Writing

### Reproducibility Checklist

- [ ] Research design clearly stated
- [ ] Population/sample described
- [ ] Sampling method explained
- [ ] Data collection procedures detailed
- [ ] Variables operationally defined
- [ ] Analysis techniques specified
- [ ] Validity/reliability addressed
- [ ] Ethical considerations noted

### Common Methodologies

| Type | When to Use | Key Elements |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Experimental | Causation testing | Control/treatment, randomization |
| Survey | Attitudes/behaviors | Sample size, instrument validity |
| Case Study | Deep exploration | Context, multiple sources |
| Meta-analysis | Synthesizing studies | Inclusion criteria, effect sizes |
| Ethnography | Cultural understanding | Immersion, thick description |

## Results vs Discussion

### Results Section
- Present findings objectively
- Use past tense
- Report statistical significance
- Let tables/figures tell the story
- No interpretation

**Example**: "Participants in the treatment group showed 34% higher completion rates (M=78.2, SD=12.1) compared to control (M=58.4, SD=15.3), t(98)=7.21, p<.001."

### Discussion Section
- Interpret what results mean
- Connect to literature
- Address limitations
- Suggest implications
- Future directions

**Example**: "The significant improvement in completion rates supports Johnson's (2020) theory of scaffolded learning. However, our sample's homogeneity limits generalizability to broader populations."

## Citation Integration

### Signal Phrases
```
According to Smith (2023), ...
Research by Jones et al. (2022) demonstrates...
As Brown (2021) argues, ...
Studies have shown that... (Williams, 2020; Chen, 2019).
```

### Synthesis vs String
**String (weak)**: "Smith (2020) found X. Jones (2021) found Y. Chen (2022) found Z."

**Synthesis (strong)**: "Multiple studies converge on the finding that X (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021), though Chen (2022) notes important boundary conditions."

## Whitepaper Structure

```
1. Executive Summary (1 page)
2. Problem Statement
3. Background/Context
4. Solution Overview
5. Detailed Analysis
6. Implementation Considerations
7. Recommendations
8. Conclusion
9. Appendices (technical details)
```

## Academic Voice

### Characteristics
- Third person (typically)
- Hedged claims ("suggests" vs "proves")
- Formal vocabulary
- Precise terminology
- Evidence-based assertions

### Hedging Language

| Strength | Language |
|----------|----------|
| Strong | demonstrates, establishes, proves |
| Moderate | suggests, indicates, implies |
| Tentative | may, might, could, appears to |

### Avoid
- First person (unless field allows)
- Contractions
- Colloquialisms
- Emotional language
- Absolute claims without evidence

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Overgeneralizing | Use appropriate hedging |
| Underciting | Support all claims |
| Passive overuse | Mix active and passive |
| Jargon without definition | Define terms first use |
| Results in discussion | Keep sections distinct |
| Weak transitions | Use signposting |
