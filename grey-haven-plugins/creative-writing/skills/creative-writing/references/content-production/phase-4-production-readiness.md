## Objectives

Phase 4 is the final quality gate before content enters production. The lead performs this phase directly -- no agent is dispatched. The goal is verification, not creation. Nothing new is produced; everything existing is evaluated for completeness, alignment, and readiness.

### 1. Strategy-Outline Alignment Verification

For each content piece, verify that the outline faithfully serves the strategy:

- [ ] Target persona is clearly addressed throughout the outline
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in title and key headings
- [ ] Content angle matches the strategic positioning (not a generic treatment)
- [ ] Content type and target word count match the strategy specification
- [ ] Publishing timeline is still realistic given the outline complexity

Misalignment between strategy and outline means one of them is wrong. Resolve before approving.

### 2. Research Integration Verification

Verify that Phase 2 research is properly incorporated into Phase 3 outlines:

- [ ] Key facts from research briefs appear in relevant outline sections
- [ ] Statistics have source attribution and dates
- [ ] No outline section makes unsupported claims
- [ ] Research gaps flagged in Phase 2 have been addressed or acknowledged
- [ ] Counter-arguments and alternative perspectives are represented where appropriate

An outline that ignores its research brief will produce content that sounds authoritative but lacks substance.

### 3. SEO Target Verification

Verify that keyword strategy is properly reflected in outlines:

- [ ] Every content piece has a primary keyword assigned
- [ ] Keyword placement in outlines is natural, not forced
- [ ] Search intent alignment confirmed (outline structure matches what searchers expect)
- [ ] Keyword cluster coverage is complete (no gaps in the keyword map)
- [ ] Competitive differentiation is evident (outlines offer something competitors do not)

### 4. Word Count Allocation Verification

Verify that word count allocations are reasonable:

- [ ] Section allocations sum to the target word count (within 10%)
- [ ] No section is allocated less than 50 words (too thin to be meaningful)
- [ ] High-value sections (backed by strong research) have proportionally more words
- [ ] Introduction and conclusion are proportionate (5-10% each)
- [ ] Allocation reflects the reader's journey (more space for complex topics)

### 5. Final CRS Scoring

Score each dimension for the complete content package:

**Alignment (A)**: Does the content plan serve the business goals, target the right audience, and cover the right keywords?

**Research (R)**: Is the research thorough, well-sourced, recent, and properly integrated into outlines?

**Structure (S)**: Are the outlines complete, logically structured, properly allocated, and production-ready?

Record the composite CRS and compare to the Phase 1 baseline. The final CRS should meet or exceed the Phase 1 score.

## Verification Checklist

The lead works through this checklist for each content piece:

### Per-Piece Verification

- [ ] Strategy alignment confirmed (persona, keyword, angle, type)
- [ ] Research integration confirmed (facts, sources, statistics mapped)
- [ ] SEO targets confirmed (keyword placement, intent alignment)
- [ ] Word count allocation confirmed (reasonable distribution)
- [ ] Argument flow confirmed (logical progression, no gaps)
- [ ] No outstanding research gaps or strategy conflicts unresolved

### Package-Level Verification

- [ ] All content pieces have complete outlines
- [ ] Content calendar dependencies are respected (pillar before cluster)
- [ ] Brand voice guidelines from config are reflected in outline tone directives
- [ ] Cross-piece consistency verified (no contradictions between related pieces)
- [ ] CRS scored for each piece and for the package as a whole

## Output: Content Production Package

The final deliverable of Phase 4 is the Content Production Package -- a complete handoff document for writers. It contains:

### 1. Strategy Summary
- Business goals and success metrics
- Audience personas (from Phase 1)
- Keyword map with assignments (from Phase 1)
- Competitive positioning (from Phase 1)

### 2. Research Briefs
- Per-piece research briefs (from Phase 2)
- Source library with credibility notes
- Key statistics with attribution

### 3. Production-Ready Outlines
- Per-piece outlines with full hierarchy (from Phase 3)
- Keyword placement maps
- Word count allocations
- Research integration notes

### 4. Production Metadata
- Content calendar with dates and dependencies
- Brand voice guidelines
- CRS scores (Phase 1 baseline and Phase 4 final)
- Any outstanding notes or caveats for writers

## Proceed / Hold Decision

### APPROVE for Production If

- [ ] All per-piece verifications pass
- [ ] All package-level verifications pass
- [ ] Final CRS composite is 7 or above
- [ ] No unresolved research gaps or strategy conflicts
- [ ] Content Production Package is assembled and complete

### HOLD If

- [ ] CRS composite dropped below Phase 1 baseline -- investigate regression
- [ ] Outstanding research gaps that could produce inaccurate content
- [ ] Strategy-outline misalignment on key pieces
- [ ] Word count allocations that suggest thin or bloated sections

### RETURN TO PHASE If

- [ ] Strategy needs fundamental revision -- return to Phase 1
- [ ] Research is insufficient for key pieces -- return to Phase 2
- [ ] Outlines need restructuring -- return to Phase 3

Record decision and commit: `content: phase 4 production-readiness complete - <project>`

*The last checkpoint before production is not a rubber stamp. It is the moment where honest evaluation prevents wasted writing effort.*
