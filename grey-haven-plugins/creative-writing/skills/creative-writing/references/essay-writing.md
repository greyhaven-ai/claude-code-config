## Essay Structure

### Classic Five-Paragraph (Starting Point)

```

```

### Advanced Structures

to explore content in unexpected ways
```

**Lyric Essay**
```
Fragment 1 ── white space ── Fragment 2 ── white space
(Associative leaps, image-driven, reader completes connections)
```

## Opening Strategies

### The Scene
Drop reader into a specific moment with sensory detail.

### The Question
Pose a compelling question the essay will explore.

### The Contradiction
Present a paradox that needs resolution.

### The Bold Statement
Make a claim that demands support.

### The Image
Begin with a vivid, resonant image.

## Thesis Development

### Strong vs Weak Thesis

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Vague, obvious | Specific, arguable |
| "Social media has effects" | "Instagram's infinite scroll exploits the same neural pathways as slot machines" |
| States fact | Makes claim |
| "Shakespeare wrote plays" | "Hamlet's delay reflects not weakness but philosophical paralysis" |

### Thesis Placement

- **Beginning**: Clear, traditional, argument-driven
- **End**: Discovery structure, builds to insight
- **Implied**: Literary, reader draws conclusion

## Evidence and Support

### Types of Evidence

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Personal anecdote | Making abstract concrete | Your experience |
| Expert testimony | Building credibility | Quoted research |
| Statistics | Demonstrating scale | Specific numbers |
| Examples | Illustrating patterns | Case studies |
| Analogy | Explaining complex ideas | Comparison to known |

### Integration

Don't drop quotes—introduce, quote, analyze:
```
1. Signal phrase (According to...)
2. Quotation or paraphrase
3. Your analysis (This shows that...)
```

## Voice and Style

### Finding Your Voice

- Read your writing aloud
- Notice your natural rhythms
- Embrace your quirks
- Be specific about what only you noticed

### Sentence Variety

Mix:
- Length (short for impact, long for complexity)
- Structure (simple, compound, complex)
- Opening (subject, prepositional phrase, gerund)

### The "I" Problem

Personal essays require "I" but:
- Don't start every paragraph with "I"
- Vary placement within sentences
- Balance introspection with observation

## Revision Strategies

### Macro-Level

- [ ] Does it have a clear through-line?
- [ ] Does each paragraph earn its place?
- [ ] Does it build to something?
- [ ] Is the ending earned?

### Micro-Level

- [ ] Cut first paragraph (often throat-clearing)
- [ ] Remove "very," "really," "just"
- [ ] Replace abstract nouns with concrete ones
- [ ] Vary sentence openings

### The "So What?" Test

After every paragraph, ask: So what? Why does this matter?
If you can't answer, cut or deepen.

## Transitions

### Between Ideas

| Purpose | Transitions |
|---------|-------------|
| Addition | moreover, furthermore, additionally |
| Contrast | however, yet, conversely |
| Example | for instance, specifically, consider |
| Cause/effect | therefore, consequently, thus |
| Time | meanwhile, subsequently, later |

### Organic Transitions

Better than transition words:
- Repeat a key word from previous paragraph
- Use a question that the next paragraph answers
- Create logical flow where transition is unnecessary

## Common Mistakes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Starting too broad | Begin in medias res |
| Summarizing instead of analyzing | Ask "why" and "how" |
| Forgetting the reader | Consider what they need to know |
| Ending with summary | End with resonance or question |
| All tell, no show | Include scene and detail |
| Hedging too much | Commit to your claims |
