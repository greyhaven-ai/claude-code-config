# Fiction Writing Guide

Guide for novels, short stories, and narrative fiction.

## Story Structure

### Three-Act Structure

```
ACT I (25%)           ACT II (50%)           ACT III (25%)
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Setup           │ Confrontation           │ Resolution      │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤

│ • Inciting      │ • Midpoint shift        │ • Falling action│
│   incident      │ • Complications         │ • Resolution    │
│ • First plot pt │ • Second plot point     │ • New normal    │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Scene Structure

Every scene needs:
- **Goal**: What does the POV character want?
- **Conflict**: What opposes them?
- **Outcome**: Success, failure, or complication?

```
Scene → Sequel Pattern:

SCENE                    SEQUEL
Goal                     Reaction (emotional)
Conflict                 Dilemma (what now?)
Disaster/Outcome         Decision (new goal)
```

## Character Development

### Character Layers

| Layer | Elements | Reveals Through |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Surface | Appearance, mannerisms, speech | Description, dialogue |
| Social | Role, relationships, reputation | Interactions, others' views |
| Private | Fears, desires, secrets | Internal monologue, choices |
| Core | Fundamental belief/wound | Crisis moments, climax |

### Character Arc Types

**Positive arc**: Belief → Challenge → Growth → New belief
**Negative arc**: Strength → Corruption → Fall → Destruction
**Flat arc**: Strong belief → Tests → Unchanged → World changes

### Dialogue Principles

- Each character has distinct voice (vocabulary, rhythm, tics)
- Subtext > explicit statement
- Dialogue advances plot or reveals character
- Avoid "on-the-nose" dialogue
- Action beats over dialogue tags

## Point of View

### POV Options

| POV | Intimacy | Flexibility | Best For |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| First | High | Limited | Voice-driven, unreliable narrator |
| Third Limited | Medium | Moderate | Most commercial fiction |
| Third Omniscient | Low | High | Epic scope, multiple storylines |
| Second | Very High | Very Limited | Experimental, choose-your-own |

### POV Consistency

- Stay in one head per scene (usually)
- Don't reveal what POV character can't know
- Filter all observations through POV character's voice

## Show vs Tell

### When to Show
- Emotional moments
- Character-defining actions
- Key plot points
- Sensory experiences

### When to Tell
- Transitions
- Backstory (briefly)
- Time passage
- Less important information

### Show Examples

```
Tell: She was angry.
Show: Her knuckles whitened around the coffee cup.

Tell: The room was messy.
Show: Pizza boxes formed a leaning tower by the couch. Somewhere
      beneath the clothes pile, a phone buzzed unanswered.

Tell: He was nervous about the interview.
Show: He'd retied his tie three times. Four. The mirror showed
      a stranger wearing his father's suit.
```

## Pacing

### Speed Controls

| Technique | Effect | Use For |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Short sentences | Faster | Action, tension, shock |
| Long sentences | Slower | Reflection, description |
| Scene (real-time) | Slow | Important moments |
| Summary | Fast | Transitions, backstory |
| White space | Pause | Impact, transition |

### Chapter/Scene Length

- Thriller: 1,500-3,000 words per chapter
- Literary: 3,000-5,000 words per chapter
- YA: 2,000-4,000 words per chapter
- End chapters on hooks or questions

## World-Building

### Iceberg Principle

Show 10%, know 100%. Reveal world through:
- Character interactions with environment
- Casual references (not info-dumps)
- Sensory details specific to setting
- How characters take things for granted

### World-Building Checklist

- [ ] Physical environment (geography, climate)
- [ ] Social structure (power, class, customs)
- [ ] Technology/magic level
- [ ] Economy and resources
- [ ] History that affects present
- [ ] Language and communication

## Genre Conventions

### Mystery
- Fair play: clues available to reader
- Red herrings to misdirect
- Satisfying reveal that's surprising but inevitable

### Romance
- Meet-cute establishes chemistry
- Conflict keeps them apart
- Emotional black moment before resolution
- Satisfying ending (HEA or HFN)

### Thriller
- Stakes established early
- Ticking clock
- Twists and reversals
- Protagonist increasingly cornered

### Fantasy/Sci-Fi
- Clear magic/tech rules (consistency > explanation)
- World affects character choices
- Balance exposition with action

## Common Pitfalls

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Info-dumping | Reveal through action and dialogue |
| Purple prose | Cut 50% of adjectives/adverbs |
| Passive protagonist | Give them agency and choices |
| Coincidence saves hero | Hero's actions cause resolution |
| Floating heads | Ground dialogue in setting/action |
| Said-bookisms | Use "said" 90% of time |
