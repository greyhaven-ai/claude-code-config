## Hook Patterns

### The Problem-Agitate-Solve Hook
```
Problem: You've been writing blog posts for months with zero traction.
Agitate: Every post feels like shouting into the void.
Solve: Here's the framework top bloggers use to guarantee engagement.
```

### The Story Hook
```
Three years ago, I was exactly where you are now—staring at a blank
screen, wondering if anyone would ever read my words. Then I discovered
something that changed everything.
```

### The Statistic Hook
```
73% of blog posts never get a single backlink. Yet the top 1% of posts
generate 90% of all traffic. What separates them? Structure.
```

### The Contrarian Hook
```
Everything you've been taught about blog writing is wrong. Forget
"write what you know" and "find your voice." Here's what actually works.
```

## SEO Essentials

### Keyword Placement
1. **Title** - Primary keyword near the start
2. **First paragraph** - Natural mention within first 100 words
3. **Headers** - H2s should include keyword variations
4. **URL slug** - Short, keyword-focused
5. **Meta description** - Include keyword naturally

### Content Length by Intent

| Search Intent | Ideal Length | Examples |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Quick answer | 300-500 words | "What is X?" |

| Ultimate guide | 3,000-5,000 words | "Complete guide to X" |
| Listicle | 1,000-2,000 words | "Best X for Y" |

### Readability for SEO

- Bulleted lists for scanability
