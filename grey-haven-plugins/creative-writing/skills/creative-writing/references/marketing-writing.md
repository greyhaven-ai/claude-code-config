# Marketing Writing Guide

Guide for landing pages, email campaigns, ad copy, and conversion-focused content.

## Core Principles

### The Clarity Hierarchy

```
1. What is it? (Clear > Clever)
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should they care?
4. What do they do next?
```

### Value Proposition Formula

```
[Product/Service] helps [target audience] [achieve outcome]
by [key differentiator], unlike [alternative].
```

## Landing Page Structure

### Above the Fold

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADLINE (Promise + Specificity)       │
│  Subheadline (Expand on promise)        │
│  [CTA BUTTON - Primary action]          │
│  Social proof snippet                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Full Page Flow

```
1. Hero (Problem acknowledgment + Promise)
2. Problem (Agitate pain points)
3. Solution (Your approach)
4. Features → Benefits (What → So what)
5. Social Proof (Testimonials, logos, stats)
6. FAQ (Handle objections)
7. Final CTA (Risk reversal + urgency)
```

## Headlines

### Formula Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How to X without Y | "How to Write Copy Without Sounding Salesy" |
| X Ways to Y | "7 Ways to Double Your Email Open Rates" |
| The Secret to X | "The Secret to Landing Pages That Convert" |
| Why X Doesn't Work | "Why Your Marketing Isn't Working" |
| X for Y | "Enterprise Security for Startup Budgets" |

### Headline Checklist

- [ ] Specific (numbers, outcomes)
- [ ] Benefit-focused (not feature-focused)
- [ ] Addresses target audience
- [ ] Creates curiosity or urgency
- [ ] Passes the "so what" test

## Features vs Benefits

### Translation Framework

```
Feature → "So you can..." → Benefit → "Which means..." → Emotional payoff

"256-bit encryption"
→ "So you can store sensitive data securely"
→ "Which means you'll never worry about data breaches"
```

### Examples

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 24/7 support | Get help when you need it, not when we're open |
| AI-powered | Finish in minutes what used to take hours |
| Cloud-based | Access your work from anywhere, any device |
| Integrates with Slack | Keep your team informed without switching apps |

## Email Marketing

### Subject Line Formulas

- Question: "Still struggling with X?"
- Curiosity gap: "The one thing most marketers miss..."
- Urgency: "Last chance: X expires tonight"
- Benefit: "Get X in just Y minutes"
- Personal: "[Name], quick question about X"

### Email Structure

```
Subject: Curiosity + benefit
Preview text: Extends subject, doesn't repeat

Line 1: Hook (personal, relevant)
Line 2-3: Problem/context
Line 4-5: Solution/offer
Line 6: Single CTA
PS: Secondary benefit or urgency
```

### Email Principles

- One email = one goal
- Write like a person, not a company
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Mobile-first (preview on phone)
- Test subject lines (A/B)

## Ad Copy

### Facebook/Instagram

```
Hook (stop the scroll) - 1-2 lines
Problem agitation - 1-2 lines
Solution introduction - 1-2 lines
Proof point - 1 line
CTA - Clear action
```

### Google Ads

- Headline 1: Keyword + benefit (30 chars)
- Headline 2: Differentiator (30 chars)
- Headline 3: CTA (30 chars)
- Description: Expand on promise, include offer

### LinkedIn

- Professional tone, personal voice
- Lead with insight or question
- Provide value before asking
- Specific results > vague claims

## Social Proof

### Hierarchy of Proof

1. **Specific results** ("Increased revenue 347%")
2. **Named testimonials** (Photo, name, title, company)
3. **Logo bar** (Recognizable companies)
4. **Numbers** ("10,000+ customers")
5. **Generic testimonials** (Use sparingly)

### Testimonial Formula

```
"[Specific result/transformation].
[What they were struggling with before].
[How product/service helped].
[Recommendation]."
```

## CTA Optimization

### Button Copy

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Submit | Get My Free Guide |
| Learn More | See How It Works |
| Buy Now | Start Saving Today |
| Sign Up | Join 10,000+ Members |

### CTA Principles

- First person ("Get MY..." vs "Get YOUR...")
- Action + outcome (verb + benefit)
- Reduce friction words ("free trial" not "start trial")
- Single primary CTA per section

## Handling Objections

### FAQ Framework

```
Objection: "It's too expensive"
Reframe: "Compare the cost of NOT solving this problem"

Objection: "I don't have time"
Reframe: "Takes 10 minutes to set up, saves 5 hours/week"

Objection: "Will it work for me?"
Reframe: "Here's how customers like you succeeded"
```

### Risk Reversals

- Money-back guarantee
- Free trial
- "Keep the bonuses even if you cancel"
- Pay-after-results

## Conversion Principles

### Friction Reduction

- Fewer form fields (each field = % drop-off)
- Progress indicators for multi-step
- Autofill when possible
- Mobile-optimized

### Urgency (Ethical)

- Real deadlines (sale ends, enrollment closes)
- Limited quantity (honest scarcity)
- Seasonal relevance
- Avoid fake countdown timers

## Common Mistakes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Too clever | Clarity beats cleverness |
| Feature-focused | Translate to benefits |
| No social proof | Add testimonials, logos, stats |
| Weak CTA | Specific action + outcome |
| Wall of text | Short paragraphs, bullets, whitespace |
| Multiple goals | One page, one goal |
