## Revision Tips

**Time between passes**: At least a few hours, ideally overnight

**Different media**: Print it out or change font/device

**Read backwards**: For catching typos (defeats predictive reading)

**Read aloud**: Best way to catch awkward phrasing

**Track patterns**: Note recurring issues to watch for in future

*Good writing is rewriting*
