# Manuscript Audit Checkpoint

Completion gate for the parallel manuscript audit. Run this checklist after all three agents have reported and before delivering the final decision.

## Scores Tracker

Record scores from each auditor:

| Auditor | Metric | Score | Threshold | Status |
|---------|--------|------:|-----------|--------|
| Prose Style Analyst | SVQ Composite | /10 | >= 7.0 ACCEPT | |
| Prose Style Analyst | S (Style) | /10 | — | |
| Prose Style Analyst | V (Voice) | /10 | — | |
| Prose Style Analyst | Q (Quality) | /10 | — | |
| Believability Auditor | Believability | /100 | >= 80 ACCEPT | |
| Believability Auditor | Verisimilitude | /25 | — | |
| Believability Auditor | Internal Consistency | /25 | — | |
| Believability Auditor | Plausibility | /25 | — | |
| Believability Auditor | Mimesis | /25 | — | |
| World Builder | Critical Issues | | 0 for ACCEPT | |
| World Builder | Major Issues | | 0 for ACCEPT | |
| World Builder | Minor Issues | | — | |

## Step 1: Agent Completion Verification

- [ ] Prose Style Analyst has submitted a complete report
- [ ] Believability Auditor has submitted a complete report
- [ ] World Builder has submitted a complete report
- [ ] All three reports include chapter/section locations for cross-referencing

---

## Step 2: Scores Recorded

- [ ] SVQ composite and individual dimension scores recorded
- [ ] SVQ justifications include quoted evidence for each dimension
- [ ] Believability score and subscale breakdown recorded
- [ ] Believability findings categorized by severity
- [ ] World Consistency Matrix produced with severity counts per category
- [ ] All scores entered in the Scores Tracker above

---

## Step 3: Cross-Reference Identification

- [ ] Passages flagged by multiple auditors identified
- [ ] Cross-referenced issues elevated to highest priority
- [ ] Severity conflicts resolved (highest severity wins)
- [ ] Cross-reference count recorded: _____ issues flagged by 2+ auditors

---

## Step 4: Synthesis Complete

Apply the agreement protocol from the Manuscript Audit SOP:

- [ ] All-3-agree issues: included at highest priority
- [ ] 2-of-3-agree issues: included with dissenting view noted
- [ ] All-3-disagree issues: flagged for author decision with all perspectives
- [ ] Severity escalation applied (highest severity wins on shared issues)
- [ ] Unified findings list produced, ordered by priority

---

## Step 5: Decision

Apply acceptance thresholds:

| Criterion | Value | Threshold | Result |
|-----------|------:|-----------|--------|
| SVQ Composite | | >= 7.0 | |
| Believability | | >= 80 | |
| World Critical Issues | | 0 | |
| **Overall Decision** | | | |

Decision rules:
- **ACCEPT**: SVQ >= 7.0 AND Believability >= 80 AND no critical world issues
- **REVISE**: SVQ 5.0-6.9 OR Believability 60-79 OR major world issues
- **REWORK**: SVQ < 5.0 OR Believability < 60 OR critical world issues
- Lowest applicable decision governs the overall result

- [ ] ACCEPT / REVISE / REWORK decision recorded with justification

---

## Step 6: Revision Recommendations

If decision is REVISE or REWORK:

- [ ] Revision recommendations documented, ordered by priority
- [ ] Each recommendation linked to specific auditor findings
- [ ] Cross-referenced issues prioritized above single-auditor findings
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (specific passages, specific issues)

If decision is ACCEPT:

- [ ] Minor findings documented as optional polish items
- [ ] Strengths noted for author awareness

---

## Step 7: Report Delivery

- [ ] Decision report includes individual agent summaries
- [ ] Decision report includes unified cross-referenced findings
- [ ] Decision report includes ACCEPT/REVISE/REWORK decision with justification
- [ ] Decision report includes revision recommendations (if applicable)
- [ ] Report delivered to author

*Three lenses, one verdict. The audit is complete when the evidence speaks with a single voice.*
