# Princeton GEO Methods

The 9 Generative Engine Optimization methods from Princeton research, ranked by visibility boost.

## Overview

GEO optimizes content to be **cited** by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot, Claude). Unlike traditional SEO which optimizes for ranking algorithms, GEO optimizes for citation by language models.

## The 9 Methods

### 1. Cite Sources (+40% visibility)

Add authoritative citations and references throughout content.

**How to apply:**
- Link to primary research, official documentation, industry reports
- Use inline citations: "According to [Source], ..."
- Prefer .gov, .edu, and established industry sources
- Include publication dates for freshness signals

**Example:**
```
According to a 2024 Stanford study, AI search engines cite content with
references 40% more frequently than uncited content (Smith et al., 2024).
```

### 2. Statistics Addition (+37% visibility)

Include specific numbers, data points, and quantified claims.

**How to apply:**
- Replace vague claims with specific numbers
- Include percentages, dollar amounts, time periods
- Cite the source of statistics
- Use recent data (within 1-2 years)

**Example:**
```
Bad:  "Most companies use cloud computing."
Good: "94% of enterprises use cloud services, with average spending
       reaching $482,000 annually (Flexera, 2024)."
```

### 3. Quotation Addition (+30% visibility)

Add expert quotes with proper attribution.

**How to apply:**
- Quote recognized experts in the field
- Include name, title, and organization
- Use direct quotes, not paraphrased
- Place quotes near relevant claims for context

**Example:**
```
"The future of search is not about ten blue links—it's about
synthesized answers," says Dr. Jane Smith, Director of AI Research
at Stanford University.
```

### 4. Authoritative Tone (+25% visibility)

Use confident, expert language throughout.

**How to apply:**
- Write declarative statements, not hedging language
- Use domain-specific terminology correctly
- Present information with confidence
- Avoid unnecessary qualifiers ("maybe", "perhaps", "it seems")

**Example:**
```
Bad:  "It seems like TypeScript might be better than JavaScript for large projects."
Good: "TypeScript provides critical type safety for large-scale applications,
       reducing runtime errors by up to 15% in production environments."
```

### 5. Easy-to-Understand (+20% visibility)

Simplify complex concepts for broader accessibility.

**How to apply:**
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Break long sentences into shorter ones
- Include a TL;DR or summary at the top

### 6. Technical Terms (+18% visibility)

Include domain-specific terminology.

**How to apply:**
- Use correct technical vocabulary
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Include acronym expansions on first use
- Match terminology to the target audience's expertise level

### 7. Unique Words (+15% visibility)

Increase vocabulary diversity.

**How to apply:**
- Avoid repeating the same words/phrases
- Use synonyms and varied phrasing
- Include specialized vocabulary relevant to the topic
- Don't sacrifice clarity for vocabulary diversity

### 8. Fluency Optimization (+15-30% visibility)

Improve readability and flow.

**How to apply:**
- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)
- Use transition words between sections
- Ensure logical paragraph flow
- Read aloud to check rhythm

### 9. Keyword Stuffing (-10% visibility) - AVOID

**This method HURTS visibility.** Do not unnaturally repeat keywords.
